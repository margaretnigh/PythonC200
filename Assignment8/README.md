## Code Review & style (40/40 pts)
Your code is reviewed for proper style and legibility.
If your code passes the autograder, but you violated the specifications (for example using forbidden python features/functions), you will lose the autograder points as well!

    - `B`: 1/1
    - `Bt`: 2/2
    - `x`: 1/1

    TA Note: Not going to take points off but make sure you're removing the pass keyword when you do your implementation.


- Forbidden functions used (if any): _


## Pytest Results
- Test test_occurs_r on input (2, [2]) should result in True
  but your code gave False
